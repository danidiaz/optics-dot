# optics-dot

Use `OverloadedRecordDot` for nested field access and modification using optics from the ["optics-core"](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics-core) package.

See the Haddocks for the `Optics.Dot` module for an example.

(Note that "optics-core" already has some helpers for generating field lenses, in the [`Optics.Label`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics-core-0.4.1.1/docs/Optics-Label.html) module.)
